Mass Line Edit for Sale Orders
==============================

This module allows you to quickly update multiple sale order lines at once in any quotation or sales order.

Features:
---------
* **Master Toggle**: Add a *Select All Lines* checkbox at the top of the order form to enable bulk selection.
* **Per-Line Control**: Each sale order line gets an *Apply to All* toggle (boolean switch).
* **Mass Editing**: When you edit a field on one line with *Apply to All* enabled, the same change is automatically applied to all other selected lines in the same order.
* Works on both quotations and confirmed sales orders (subject to Odoo's standard field edit restrictions).
* Prevents infinite loops with a safe propagation mechanism.

Benefits:
---------
* Save time by editing once and applying changes to multiple lines.
* Reduce human error by ensuring consistent values across multiple order lines.
